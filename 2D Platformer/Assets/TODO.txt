Achievements:
Add some type of achievement system
Some type of awards for completing achievements
Some type of basic networking setup would be nice. Something as simple as an online leaderboard.
Would be cool to have the "fastest player" get something special as long as they are still the fastest played based on the leaderboards.


UI:
Start menu
Controls Screen


Timer:
Add timer and a complete time


Difuculty Selector:
How would this work with leaderboards? 
Enemy would just be faster?
Would anything else happen?
 

Enemy:
Add some type of world moving to the right "Mario Style" or using the Shadow Enemy idea from v1. Actually I could make the enemy
animated  character that comes with the platformer art. Could be a cool way to practice some AI.
Create Enemy Object
RigidBodyMovement2D is created and ready for an EnemyControls script to inherit from.
Setup Animations and Animator
Setup AI movement
AI Jumping
AI Attacking the Player
Should the enemy get faster oif lets say it almost hit you? 


 Misc:
Would be cool in some way to have a customizable character. Probably not super doable with the red hood character. 
Breakable items need setup: Will probably want an idamagle interface for that. Also need to figure out how to "explode/break" objects.
Some time of scenemanager will also be wanted
Doing lights again? IInteractable interface? Interactable abstract class?


End Polish:
Level design
Implement some webgl safe post processing
Same goes for particles affects
sfx will need implemented
