Add some type of achievement system
Some type of awards for completing achievements
Add timer and a complete time
Add some type of world moving to the right "Mario Style" or using the Shadow Enemy idea from v1.
Some type of basic networking setup would be nice. Something as simple as an online leaderboard. 
Would be cool in some way to have a customizable character. Probably not super doable with the red hood character. 
Breakable items need setup: Will probably want an idamagle interface for that. 
Some time of scenemanager will also be wanted
Doing lights again?
