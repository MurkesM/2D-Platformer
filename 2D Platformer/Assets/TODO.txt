Achievements:
Add some type of achievement system
Some type of awards for completing achievements
Some type of basic networking setup would be nice. Something as simple as an online leaderboard.
Would be cool to have the "fastest player" get something special as long as they are still the fastest played based on the leaderboards.


Timer:
Add timer and a complete time
Add some type of world moving to the right "Mario Style" or using the Shadow Enemy idea from v1.
 

 Misc:
Would be cool in some way to have a customizable character. Probably not super doable with the red hood character. 
Breakable items need setup: Will probably want an idamagle interface for that. Also need to figure out how to "explode/break" objects.
Some time of scenemanager will also be wanted
Doing lights again? IInteractable interface?


End Polish:
Level design
Implement some webgl safe post processing
Same goes for particles affects
sfx will need implemented
